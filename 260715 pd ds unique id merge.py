260715 pd ds unique id merge.py

Merge PII/PHI person records from an Excel export into ONE ROW PER confirmed
identity, using "Unique ID" as the primary grouping key - but NOT trusting it
blindly. Unlike "260711 pd ds notification merge.py" (which clusters rows
via fuzzy SSN/Name/DOB/ID/Address matching across the WHOLE dataset), here
Unique ID does the heavy lifting, with two safety rules layered on top:

  1. A blank/missing Unique ID never merges with another blank - each such
     row gets its own group, since treating all blanks as "the same ID"
     would incorrectly combine unrelated rows.
  2. A row whose First Name AND Last Name are BOTH entirely blank (or a
     placeholder like "[Unknown]"/"N/A" - see NAME_PLACEHOLDERS/norm_name())
     still merges normally into whichever Named row(s) share its Unique ID -
     a shared Unique ID is enough on its own for an Unknown-named row, since
     rule 3 below can never flag a name CONFLICT against a blank/placeholder
     name (a real name is required on both sides to disagree).
  3. Within one Unique ID's rows, two rows are split apart (kept as separate
     people) whenever their First Name AND Last Name BOTH genuinely differ
     (a real, non-blank value on both sides that disagrees) UNLESS a
     matching, real (non-blank on both sides) SSN or DOB confirms they're
     actually the same person despite the name difference - a shared Unique
     ID is not trusted enough to override a genuine identity conflict on its
     own (see name_conflict_blocks_merge()/split_bucket_by_identity()). This
     split uses the same transitive-safe "refuse if it would combine two
     conflicting known identities" pattern as the notification-merge
     script's SSN/DOB/address guards, so a chain of rows can't quietly
     bridge two genuinely different people together.
  4. Within one Unique ID's rows, two rows are ALSO split apart whenever
     their Social Security Number AND Full Date of Birth BOTH genuinely
     differ (real, non-blank values on both sides that disagree) - even if
     the First/Last Name match or are blank (see ssn_dob_conflict()).
     Unlike rule 3, there is no override for this one: a matching Name does
     not excuse a genuine SSN+DOB conflict. A conflicting SSN or DOB ALONE
     (the other blank, or matching) is NOT enough to split on its own -
     both must genuinely disagree. Every row on either side of a split
     caused by this rule is tagged in the output "SSN Differs Flag" column
     ("Y") so it's easy to find and review.

Per-column merge rule, as specified for this report:

  - First Name, Last Name: the single fullest (longest) non-blank value
    among the group's rows. A placeholder value ("[Unknown]", "N/A", ...)
    never outcompetes a real name (see NAME_PLACEHOLDERS/norm_name()).
  - Middle Name: Max Length value - the single longest non-blank raw value
    (no placeholder filtering).
  - Suffix, Data Subject Type: Max Count value - the most frequently
    occurring non-blank value in the group (ties broken by first-seen
    order).
  - Social Security Number, Birth Information: the single fullest (longest)
    non-blank value.
  - Full Date of Birth (MM/DD/YYYY): the most frequently occurring real date
    among the group (compared by the NORMALIZED date - see norm_dob() - so
    the same date typed in different formats across rows is treated as one
    date, not two), always displayed as a clean "MM/DD/YYYY" string. If no
    row has a parseable date, falls back to the fullest raw text.
  - Employee Identification Number, Address Comments, Email Address -
    Personal, Phone Number, Contact Information, Driver's License Number,
    DL Issuing Country/Province/State, Passport Country/Number, Government
    ID Issuing Country, Government- Issued Identification, Government-Issued
    ID Number, Tax Identification Number, Health/Work/Family/Financial/
    Student/Demographic/Biometric Information, PI Notes, Access Credentials:
    every distinct value across the group, deduplicated and joined with "; "
    (see semicolon_merge() - a cell that already contains multiple
    semicolon-joined values is split and deduped at that token level too).
  - Residential Address, City, State, Province, Zip Code, Country of
    Residence: kept TOGETHER as one unit - the MOST COMMON (max count)
    complete address among the group's rows stays in these columns (with any
    field left blank on one row filled in from another row's fuller copy of
    that SAME address), and every OTHER, genuinely different address goes
    into a new "Other Address" column as one combined string per address,
    semicolon-joined if there's more than one.
  - DOCIDs: every distinct DOCID, deduplicated and joined with "; ". If the
    INPUT already has "DOCIDs 2", "DOCIDs 3", ... (e.g. it's the output of a
    prior merge that itself overflowed - however many are present, with no
    fixed limit), all of those are read and merged in too - not just
    "DOCIDs" - so a value that only lives in one row's "DOCIDs 3" isn't
    silently dropped. The combined, deduplicated result is then re-chunked
    for output the same way: if it would exceed Excel's 32,767-char cell
    limit, it spills into "DOCIDs 2", "DOCIDs 3", and so on (splitting only
    at "; " boundaries) - UNCAPPED, so a group's DOCID list is never
    truncated, it just takes as many columns as it needs.
  - Rows Merged (output-only): count of original rows merged into this
    identity group.
  - SSN Differs Flag (output-only): "Y" if this identity group was kept
    split apart from another group sharing the same Unique ID specifically
    because of a genuine SSN+DOB conflict (see rule 4 above /
    ssn_dob_conflict()); blank otherwise.
  - Other Address (output-only): see above.

INPUT  : an Excel workbook with the columns listed in EXPECTED_COLS below.
OUTPUT : a new Excel workbook, one sheet, "Merged Data" - one row per
         confirmed identity (a Unique ID can produce MORE than one output
         row if its rows split apart per rule 3 above).

This script does not touch the input file. Save the output only to the
secured/authorized folder for this data (never a desktop) - it contains
SSN, DOB, and other PII/PHI.

Install once:
    pip install pandas openpyxl pyxlsb

Run (uses INPUT_XLSX/OUTPUT_XLSX from the CONFIG block below as-is):
    python "260715 pd ds unique id merge.py"

Or override the input/output file on the command line instead of editing
the CONFIG block:
    python "260715 pd ds unique id merge.py" input.xlsx
